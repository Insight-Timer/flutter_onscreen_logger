## 2.0.0

* **New Interface**: Refactored the logger API to simplify logging and improve usability. Removed the need for `.init()`; now the logger is initialized automatically when you use the `LoggerOverlayController` and `LoggerOverlayWidget`.
* **New Methods**: Added `clearAll()` and `shareAll()` methods to the logger for easier log management. The `clearAll()` method clears all logged messages, and `shareAll()` allows sharing all logs via the sharing interface.
* **Updated Libraries**: Updated all used libraries to their latest versions for better compatibility and performance.
